The Quarantine Gates are sealed to prevent the spread of necrotic contagion emanating from the catacombs beneath the crypt. Two immediate objectives will advance your progress: obtain official clearance or bypass the gate with a valid countermeasure, and secure the Purge Codex fragment within the crypt.\n\nIf you prefer legitimacy: speak with Captain Merelle (north of the gate).

If you lack both, you will need the latter route: seep into the crypt via the collapsed drain on the eastern wall (half-hidden by brambles) and retrieve the Codex fragment from the third alcove downrange.

The undead in this region are sustained by the plague\u2019s shadow-threads. Effective tools: radiant damage (Blessed weapons, Sunstone-infused arrows), fire to disrupt rot-threads, and Alchemist\u2019s Anti-Rot vials to prevent infection on hit. Prioritize ranged attacks to sever the necrotic binding points (glowing vertebrae or the blackened heart in elite revenants). A healer or cleric with Purge Channel is invaluable \u2014 their interrupts can collapse a group\u2019s cohesion so you can finish the core.\n\nTactical tip: the elite wights regenerate if they reach adjacent corpse piles.

You can craft it with 1x Purified Salt, 1x Sunflower Root, and 1x Basilisk Gland at a healer\u2019s table, or purchase at the Temple of Dawn.\n\n2) During engagement: keep distance, use anti-rot vials when livestock or corpses are present, and avoid touching sealed relics without gloves. Use the Cloak of Aegis (if available) which reduces contact transmission.\n\n3) Immediate field cure: if infected, apply a Freshband of Purity (disables symptom progression for 10 minutes) and withdraw to a safe distance to perform a Purge Rite (requires a cleric or a Purge Scroll). Without those, repeatedly administering anti-rot vials can stall symptoms but is not a true cure.\n\nNote: repeated infection without full cure increases resistance of the plague to common remedies.

Both have consequences.\n- Keep spare inventory space for reagents; the Codex demands specific items that cannot be improvised in the cauldron.\n- Save before entering sealed wards; the alcove puzzle and the crypt\u2019s boss have scripted events that can wipe unprepared parties.\n\nIf you wish, I can annotate a step-by-step checklist for your journal: routes to the eastern drain, sequence to extinguish the candles, exact reagent counts, and combat priority targets.

Use Anti-Rot on strike if bitten.\n6) Acquire Temple Distillate: assist Brother Kellan at the Temple of Dawn\u2019s Outer Hall cleansing quest.\n7) Obtain Archivist's Cipher: visit Archive of Sable \u2014 trade or solve the librarian\u2019s riddle for the binder.\n8) Synthesis: at the Sanctum of Mending, combine Codex scheme + Distillate + Cipher in a silver-lined basin, activate with Sunstone flare.\n9) Administer Grand Antidote: distribute according to your chosen strategy (immediate wide distribution or prioritized for key NPCs).\n10) Decontaminate: pass all gear through the Font of Purity to remove latent contagion; document samples for the Archive.\n\nIf you want, I can transcribe this into your in-game journal for quick reference.

Stock 2 Mana Flasks, a Silence rune, and a Dispel Scroll. 2) In the Librarium: talk to Lira. If she wants a favor, fetch the 'Dust of Old Ink' from the basement \u2014 it's a quick fetch and will buy your distraction. 3) Use the east shelf trick: pull the third book from the right (it squeaks) to open the spiral stair. 4) Clocktower Observatory: grab the Prism of Lys from the side cabinet (it's wrapped in green cloth). There are three stone pedestals with recessed sigils. Place the prism on the center pedestal, rotate the outer lenses so that a narrow beam passes through all three and hits the prism. If you can't see the beam, cast True Sight or dust the lenses \u2014 dust and misaligned spheres are the usual culprits. 5) If golems activate: they hate disruptive water spells and stagger when you hit their core rune with a Bolt of Cold. Aim for the back when they reset; they have a blind spot at the base plate. 6) Once the Vault opens, you may face a moral/arcane consequence: the Heart senses intent. Hold the artifact with a Clean Hand charm or it will bind to hostile intent and smite you. 7) Exit: either replace the Heart with a weighted stone (most clever route) or sign the registry if you went the diplomatic route.
